Creating the perfect bite in every hamburger or sandwich comes down to how you stack it. Follow these simple steps to ensure a delicious and structurally sound masterpiece.

## Ingredients:

- High-quality bun
- Condiments of your choice (mayo, mustard, ketchup, etc.)
- Meat patty (beef, chicken, or plant-based)
- Cheese (cheddar, Swiss, American, etc.)
- Lettuce
- Tomato
- Onions (raw or caramelized)
- Additional toppings (optional)

## Steps:

1. **Toast Your Bun** - Begin with a sturdy, toasted bun to prevent sogginess.
2. **Spread Condiments** - Apply your choice of condiments on the bottom bun to season the patty and protect the bun.
3. **Layer Lettuce and Tomato** - Add lettuce to protect the bun from getting soggy from the tomato, then place the tomato slice on top for juiciness.
4. **Add the Patty** - Place your cooked meat patty on top of the condiment-layered bottom bun.
5. **Melt the Cheese** - Lay a slice of cheese on the hot patty to melt.
6. **More Condiments (Optional)** - Spread any additional condiments on the inside of the top bun.
7. **Cap It Off** - Place the top bun on your stack.
8. **Serve Immediately** - For the best experience, enjoy your hamburger or sandwich right away.

## Tips:

- **Press Gently** - Before serving, press down gently on the top bun to meld the ingredients slightly, making it easier to eat.
- **Customize** - Feel free to adjust the order or ingredients based on personal preference. The key is to balance flavors and textures while maintaining the structure.
