There is a list of projects I've started on my whiteboard. Rather than crossing off items, to indicate they have been completed, the list has gotten longer.

Here are some items on the list (don't steal please):

- immigrii - A platform similar to TurboTax but for immigration documents.

- knowhance - A directory for individuals to discover and explore experts specializing in various areas of interest.

- sportstable - A hub for all sports highlights.

- youtube-title-generator (title wip) - A web app that generates titles for YouTube videos using AI.

- famshare - A mobile app that helps you deepen familial connections through tailored questions.

Those are just a few. As I live my day-to-day life, I come up with ideas, and start on those ideas but don't stick them through. Others don't have an MVP yet. Most need more time spent on solidifying the concept. I am currently struggling with how to create a product and eventually monetize it.

I've been looking for courses on product design. But not sure if I should outsource it or learn the skills myself. I feel that I'm becoming more proficient with building it rather than having a vision of future growth. It's definitely not been an easy journey. The most important thing it seems is to stick to one thing, get feedback from users, then iterate.

I feel that the stage most people get stuck on is the conception of the idea. And not going back and forth constantly on the idea. Stick to one thing in the beginning and get something to have people test FAST.

I recommend everyone to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUE-icVYRFU&list=PLQ-uHSnFig5M9fW16o2l35jrfdsxGknNB&ab_channel=YCombinator) playlist brought to you by Y Combinator. Best resource so far on how to build out an idea.
