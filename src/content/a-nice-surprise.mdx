It was around 8:20 pm when the doorbell rang.

We weren't expecting anyone to come over. My mom went to open the door. I was nowhere in sight, rather upstairs doing homework.

A few seconds passed until I heard my mother's voice from downstairs. She was telling me to come downstairs and that someone was at the door. I came downstairs, and as I approached the screen door I saw a head pop out from the corner.

As I went to open the door, I noticed it was my friend. She was holding a balloon in her hand. My birthday was a few days ago. It was during the weekday so everyone was busy with work. But today was Friday, the best day of the week.

As I went to hug her, our normal greeting, I heard a group of voices coming from the corner. As I turned to see where it was coming from, I noticed it was our mutual friend group singing happy birthday. One of them was holding a delicious chocolate cake from Porto's, a well-known Cuban bakery in our area. I was completely caught off guard and surprised. A nice surprise.

A few of them have been calling me throughout the week to schedule a brunch during the weekend when everyone was free. It's a tradition we do for the birthdays of people in our group. But it was also Father's Day weekend, this weekend, so some people had other plans. I was under the assumption we'd meet the week after.

But here they were in front of me singing happy birthday. Probably one of the sweetest things someone has done for me.

I wrote a few posts back about why I despised my birthday. But after writing that I felt a sense of release, acceptance, and tranquility. I went on to actually enjoy my birthday this year.

My heart felt lighter.

I let go of all the expectations I thought I needed and had in my head from previous years and comparisons.

My friend's doing this today was the cherry on top.

I felt loved and cared for. I felt acknowledged and seen. I never want to take our friendship for granted. I strive to keep showing up and being present in their presence.
