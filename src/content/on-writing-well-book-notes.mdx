Here are my notes taken while reading [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser.
## The 4 basic principles 
- <b>Clarity</b>: Goal in writing, hard to achieve.
- <b>Simplicity</b>: Strip the language down, don't inflate. Simple style hard work.
- <b>Brevity</b>: Short is better than long, most adjectives are unnecessary . Learn to cut, enjoy cutting. Strip down to essentials. Cut last thing you wrote by 50% 
- <b>Humanity</b>: Be natural, be yourself.

## Quotes (paraphrased)

- <i>I'll never forget the day I â€¦</i>

- <i>Add life to the writing.</i>

- <i>We like writers who we most relate to.</i>

- <i>Your style is you, when someone says they like your writing they are saying they like you.</i>

- <i>Writing has ego and confidence. Self esteem , self discipline.</i>

- <i>You are writing for yourself.</i>

- <i>Writing is visual it catches the eye before it gets a chance to catch the brain.</i>

- <i>Be specific and concrete.</i>

- <i>Verbs and nouns specifically active verbs.</i>
 
- <i>Read everything out loud. Listen to what you write.</i>

- <i>Verbs and nouns specifically active verbs.</i>

- <i>Trust the process.</i>






## Auto Biography vs Memoir

- <b>Auto Biography</b>: The whole story.
- <b>Memoir</b>: Assumes the whole, focuses on one aspect of the life, self contained story set in a particular time, think small. Make it an honest connection with your past.
