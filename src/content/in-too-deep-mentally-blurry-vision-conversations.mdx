I am terrible at multitasking.

If you ask my sister, she will strongly agree.

Especially while talking to someone.

If I am having a conversation with you, all my attention is on YOU. I try my best to be fully present and truly listen. What I noticed is when I'm in this “state”, I don't pay attention to the things happening around me.

I have realized that this is not the greatest quality while driving. If I am having a conversation with you in the passenger seat, I WILL miss our exit. I will be too invested in the conversation and not be paying attention to the GPS at all.

While conversing, the surrounding environment, except the person I'm talking to, feels like a blur. The key word is “feels”. It isn't literary blurry.

Not sure if this is just a me thing.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced the same thing. I consider myself an ambivert, leaning more toward the introvert side. I can only talk to someone for so long until I mentally and physically feel drained. Once I do reach my max limit, then at that point I have entered a completely different state, exhaustion. Then I need to seclude myself for a little while to charge back up again.
