A relationship refers to the connection, association, or interaction between two or more individuals, entities, or things.

This can be the bond you have with a childhood best friend. The laughs and inside jokes you share with your sibling(s).

How do you make sure that the connection doesn't fizzle away with time?

Sometimes you can't control it.
