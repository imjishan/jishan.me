Brené Brown, a professor, author, and researcher, often references an inspiring quote from Theodore Roosevelt's address titled 'The Man in the Arena' in her podcasts, books, and interviews.

The quote goes “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither knows victory nor defeat.”

She explains what this excerpt means to her and how it helps her cope with criticism from others. Overall, no other criticism should matter besides the people who have been in the arena. Nowadays, with social media, it's easy for anyone to state their opinions and judgments of others. And when those statements end up being negative and unhelpful, it ends up being hurtful to the receiver.

Now I'm not saying that people shouldn't be able to comment on what they think and believe. Free speech and whatever. But when those comments have no value or empathy and end up being straight-up disrespectful, then that's when we have a problem. Regardless, people are going to do and say whatever they want.

Here's how I've learned how to cope with criticism. Took some time.

I try not to take it personally. If the criticism is painful, I try to become aware that it's not me but my ego that is hurting. One of my favorite books, “A New Earth” by Eckhart Tolle, mentions the act of transcending the ego. He talks about how it is in our nature as humans to attach ourselves closely to our identity and emotions. But by gaining awareness and presence one is able to overcome these emotions that feel like they're under attack.

So before reacting, take a second to breath, focus on the present moment and remember that they are not in the ring, YOU ARE. You're the one that took the risk to be vulnerable and courageous. So don't forget that.
