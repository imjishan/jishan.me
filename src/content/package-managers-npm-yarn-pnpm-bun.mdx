As a developer, one of the crucial tools you will need for managing dependencies in your project is a package manager. The most popular ones in the JavaScript ecosystem are **NPM**, **Yarn**, and **PNPM**.

However, choosing the right package manager can be daunting, especially if you're new to the game. In this blog post, we will compare NPM, Yarn, and PNPM and help you decide which one is right for you.

## [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/)

NPM is the default package manager that comes with Node.js installation. It has the largest package registry, with over one million packages. NPM is easy to use, and its commands are straightforward. It is also widely adopted and supported by most JavaScript frameworks and tools.

However, NPM's main drawback is its slow performance compared to Yarn and PNPM. It also generates a large number of nested node_modules directories, which can cause issues with disk space and file path lengths. NPM uses a lock file to ensure consistent dependency versions across all installations, but it can be problematic when dealing with complex projects.

## [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Yarn is a package manager that was created to address the performance and reliability
issues of NPM. It uses parallel downloading and caching of packages, resulting in
faster installation and dependency management. Yarn also has better security features,
such as checksum verification and package signing.

One of Yarn's unique features is its selective version resolution, which allows developers to specify different versions of a package for different parts of the project. Yarn also has a smaller ecosystem compared to NPM, but it offers better dependency management and security.

However, Yarn requires a separate installation and setup, which can be an additional hurdle for new developers. Its commands and configuration are slightly different from NPM, which can take some getting used to.

## [**PNPM**](https://pnpm.io/)

PNPM is a relatively new package manager that takes a different approach to manage dependencies. It uses a shared cache, which reduces disk space usage and improves performance by reusing packages and avoiding duplication. PNPM can use packages from both NPM and Yarn and can work with monorepos (multiple packages in a single repository).

PNPM does not use a lock file but instead creates a "shrinkwrap" file that serves a similar purpose. This approach ensures that all packages are installed and linked correctly, but it can also cause issues when dealing with complex projects with conflicting dependencies.

## **Which package manager is right for you?**

The choice of package manager depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project. If you are working on a small project and want to stick to the default package manager, NPM might be a good choice. If you are working on a larger project and need better performance and security, Yarn is a good option. If you want to reduce disk space usage and avoid package duplication, PNPM is worth considering.

In conclusion, NPM, Yarn, and PNPM are all great tools for managing dependencies in your JavaScript projects. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. Whatever package manager you choose, make sure to learn its commands and configuration to ensure a smooth development experience.
