For the last few days, I've been building the habit of writing and posting on SubStack. Didn't care if it was great or not. My goal was to make sure that I sit down for a few minutes a day to write.

Yesterday was the first day I missed in my 10-day writing streak, as you probably could tell by the title of this article. So to make up for it, I am writing two articles today. And this is one of them.

I wanted to write about streaks and breaking them.

I feel that the longer the streak the more pressure there is to keep it up. There is this looming feeling that is when the streak is going to be broken. Then rather than focusing on the present you focused on the future.

How I've with it is, just pick yourself up and start again. It sucks but there's nothing else you can do. I can't go back. But I sure am able to make it up. And not be so hard on myself, and show self-compassion.

So this is me starting again.
