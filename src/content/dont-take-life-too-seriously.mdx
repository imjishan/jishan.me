In my life, I've been fortunate enough to travel to some mesmerizing places. And when one travels, as the saying goes “you have to take photos, or else it didn't happen”. Well, I took that saying and unintentionally put my own spin on it as you are about to witness.

But before I do, I must admit for the longest time I hated taking photos of myself. Yes, hate is a strong word, but that's the word that accurately describes how I felt. I didn't like how I looked in the photos. No matter what I did, I never liked how they turned out. It was when I began making videos on YouTube and got more comfortable being in front of the camera that I got more accustomed to it. And as I began solo traveling and loving myself more I started embracing my quirks, expressing my authentic self, and not taking life too seriously something happened.

It made me not care that much about how it turned out. What I learned was that I didn't need to take it so seriously. What mattered more was remembering the experience and getting to enjoy being present. Hope you enjoy the moments I've made so far and hopefully many more to come!
