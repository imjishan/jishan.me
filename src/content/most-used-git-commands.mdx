Here are some of the most commonly use git commands I use. Wanted to put it in one place to reference back to whenever.

### Amend an unpushed commit message

```bash title="Terminal"
git commit --amend
```

### Delete a branch locally

```bash title="Terminal"
git branch -d localBranchName
```

### Delete a branch remotely

```bash title="Terminal"
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
```

### Remove commit based on commit history position

```bash title="Terminal"
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Remove .env from GitHub

```bash title="Terminal"
git rm -r --cached .env
git commit -m 'untracking .env'
git push origin master
```
