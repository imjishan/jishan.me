Here are my notes taken while reading [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.amazon.com/Almanack-Naval-Ravikant-Wealth-Happiness/dp/1544514220) by Eric Jorgenson.

## Naval's Life Formulas
- Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships
- Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep
- Exercise = High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + Rest
- Diet = Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants
- Sleep = No alarms + 8-9 hours + Circadian rhythms
- Wealth = Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment)
- Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge
- Accountability = People + Branding + Personal Platform + Taking Risk?
- Leverage = Capital + People + Intellectual Property
- Specific Knowledge = Knowing how to do something society cannot yet easily train other people to do
- Return on Investment = "Buy-and-Hold" + Valuation + Margin of Safety

- <i>A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control.</i>

- <i>A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace.</i>

- <i>Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatis-faction. Choose.</i>

## Miscellaneous

### Life Altering Choices
- There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: <b>where you live</b>, <b>who you're with</b>, and <b>what you do</b>.

### How to Get Lucky Principles
- Hope luck finds you.
- Hustle until you stumble into it.
- Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.
- Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.

### Who You Surround Yourself With
- By the way, nobody changes. Then I just distance myself from them. I cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: "The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be."

### Life is Short
- You're going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work.

### Don't Make Other People Happy
- Don't spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. It's not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you're happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy.
