Do you want to add a view counter and minute read into your Next.js 14 Blog?

Well you have come to the right place!

This was inspired by [Andreas' blog post](https://upstash.com/blog/nextjs13-approuter-view-counter), which was inspired by [Lee's blog](https://leerob.io/blog). However, it was published on April 3rd, 2023 and there have been a few updates since then. I wanted to share how I was able to get it to work with Next.js 14. And also include how to add minute read.

## Prerequisites

- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) project (will have an example one if you don't have one)

## Setting up our Next.js 14 project

All you need to add is this package

```bash title="Terminal"
npm i add @upstash/redis
```

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn add @upstash/redis
```

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm add @upstash/redis
```

```bash title="Terminal"
bun add @upstash/redis
```

## Setting up Upstash Redis

Go to [Upstash](https://upstash.com/), login or create an account. In the dashboard make sure you are on the <b>Redis</b> tab, and click <b>Create database</b>.

Enter in the <b>Name</b>, select the <b>Type</b> and <b>Region</b> and click <b>Create</b>.

When the database is finished being created, scroll down in the project dashboard to the <b>REST API</b> section. Click on <b>.env</b> and add <b>UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL</b> and <b>UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN</b> into the .env file in the project.
