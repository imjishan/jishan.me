It's real. Didn't know it until it hit. And it hit hard. Still recovering from it.

What was the breaking point? Many things.

I dreaded going into work everyday. My body tensed up walking into work. And the only thing I'd do after work is sleep. I barely had a social life. I didn't set any boundaries or know any of my limitations. I didn't use any of my PTO hours unless for a holiday or I got sick. I was exhausted.

Been working on maintaining a balance. Balance is essential or else it will end up like what it used to be.
