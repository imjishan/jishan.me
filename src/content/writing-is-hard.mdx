I wish I was better at writing.

I envy those who can write essays the day before it is due and get an A. Whereas I would spend weeks writing the essay and at best would get a B.

I've been reading more. They say that reading helps you become a better writer.

But to become an even better writer, writing every day is probably the best bet.

And that's what I have been doing.

Towards the end of the day, I write for about a half hour and post it here on this substack.

Not much editing is being done to get it to a certain level of “perfection”.

Every writer has a voice and a specific storytelling style.

It's been a journey, for sure. People with amazing storytelling capabilities captivate me. Stories help pass the time of life. They help us enjoy and remember the good times and the bad.

Hopefully, I keep getting better with each post.
