Growing up, creating meaningful friendships was a struggle for me.

I was a social butterfly in class. But as soon as the lunch bell rang I retreated into my cocoon. Everyone would have their “groups” and I didn't. I was too afraid to ask to join because I didn't want to get rejected. Also, my self-esteem wasn't the greatest at the time.

Cut to college, I didn't want to feel that way anymore so I stepped up my game. I put myself out there, showed up, became a president of a club, and mingled with others. It did take some time to get there, but nonetheless, I got there.

I started getting invited to events and people wanted to hang out after class. This was my first time experiencing being a part of many friend groups.

Came a long way from my middle school and high school days.
