In today's day and age, it's easy to compare yourself to others.

The presence of social media perpetuates it further without you realizing it.

Back when I was on Instagram, it got to a point where it got depressing. Every minute I was on there, hit every one of my insecurities.

The negative self-talk grew.

I felt that I was behind in life.

That everyone knew what they were doing and where they wanted their life to go.

That they had a much more lavish live style while I was living my “boring life”.

All of this negativity ended when I deactivated my account. Even though, in the beginning, I felt left out of what was happening in everyone's life. My life got exponentially better. I wouldn't have it any other way now.
