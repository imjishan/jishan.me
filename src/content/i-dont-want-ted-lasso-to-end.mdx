Last night was the final episode of Season 3 of Ted Lasso. I have not watched it yet. Was about to watch it right now. But wanted to write this first. I've had a writing streak going.

For those who are not familiar with the Apple+ series hit, Ted Lasso, it is a heartwarming and comedic TV show that follows an American football coach as he navigates the challenges of coaching a soccer team in England. Makes it even better that Jason Sudeikis plays the main character, Ted.

I heard of the show before and all the accolades but never got a chance to watch it. It wasn't until I was on my way back from my solo road trip to Seattle end of 2022 that I binge-watched all the episodes in the background. I was safe I promise, I'm still here writing this, aren't I?

Anyways, I got hooked. The characters were lovable, relatable, and well-rounded. The clever wordplay and situational humor were my types of humor. Not only the comedy aspect, but the way tough subjects were portrayed was beautiful and uplifting.

There has been speculation that this is the last episode of the series. I hope not. Okay, I can't wait any longer, I'm going to watch it now. Peace.
